📌 Project Overview
This project develops a COVID-19 prediction model based on polynomial regression, leveraging historical case data to estimate future trends in the pandemic’s progression.

The model uses Polynomial Regression, a machine learning technique that fits a nonlinear curve to data points, enabling the capture of complex patterns in case growth.

📈 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preparation
Input: CSV file containing Date and Cases columns.

Preprocessing:

Dates are converted to ordinal values (days since a reference date) to serve as numerical features.

The model is trained on these date-ordinal features against the case counts.

2️⃣ Model Construction
PolynomialFeatures from scikit-learn is used to expand the date feature into polynomial terms (up to the degree specified by the user).

A Linear Regression model fits this transformed data.

The degree of the polynomial (e.g., 2 for quadratic, 3 for cubic) determines the curve’s complexity.

3️⃣ Prediction & Output
The model predicts the number of cases for a user-specified number of future days.

Predictions are saved in a predictions.csv file, which includes:

Date: Future date.

Predicted_Cases: Estimated case count for that date.

A line graph overlays:

Historical case data (scatter plot).

Polynomial regression prediction (smooth curve).

⚙️ Model Parameters
Parameter	Description	Example
--degree	Degree of the polynomial used for fitting.	3
--predict_days	Number of days into the future for prediction.	30
--data	Path to the CSV file with historical data.	data/covid19_cases.csv

📊 Visualization Example
The plot generated by the model includes:

Blue points: Actual historical data points (date vs. cases).

Red dashed line: Polynomial regression curve extrapolated into the future.

This allows for an intuitive visual comparison of predicted and actual trends.

🔍 Limitations
Polynomial regression models trends but not causation (e.g., intervention effects, vaccination).

Overfitting risk: High-degree polynomials might fit noise rather than actual patterns.

Not epidemiologically sound: It does not incorporate biological, social, or epidemiological mechanisms (like reproduction number

0
R 
0

 , immunity, etc.).

📚 Conclusion
This polynomial regression-based model is a simple tool to predict future COVID-19 cases from historical data. It’s useful for:
✅ Quick trend exploration
✅ Basic scenario planning

However, for accurate forecasting and policy decision-making, epidemiological models (e.g., SIR/SEIR) are recommended.
